A collection of code I used across different projects, each folder is generally independent from the others.

# Disclaimer
 - Some code, specifically within SolarXCOD, is not original code. A big thanks to [DTZXPorter](https://github.com/dtzxporter/) and [Scobalula](https://github.com/Scobalula/) for the source code used to write XMODEL_EXPORTS and convert them to XMODEL_BINS.

 - Another big thanks to [Scobalula](https://github.com/Scobalula) for providing the code to convert and unpack packed maps such as NOG/CS/SG correctly.
